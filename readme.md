## The problem

I have two shower modes, one that heats the water with electricity and other that heats with solar panels.

### Electricity

#### Pros

- Easy to use
- Easy to regulate the temperature

#### Cons

- Waste huge amounts of energy
- It need energy to work


### Solar panels

#### Pros

- Does not waste energy
- Does not need energy to work

#### Cons

- Hard to regulate the temperature
- It depends on the weather temperature


## Solution

To use artificial intelligence to understand and learn the water temperature you like the most, and by doing that it will make much easier to regulate the right water temperature for you saving water and energy.
